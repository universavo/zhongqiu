## ZHONGQIU  
A simple HTML project for FUN.  

#### [NOTICE]
After ```git clone %this```, run ```npm i``` to install dependency packages.  
Then run ```npm run watch``` and ```npm run bsstart``` in two seperated bash.  
Thus any modification in the workspace will show immediately in the webpage just opened.  
**Always work in the dev directory** ```app/```. Run ```npm run dist``` to clean the workspace, if you made some changes manually by mistake outside the dev directory.
